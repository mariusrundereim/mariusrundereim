### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Marius Rundereim

I currently study front-end developer on Noroff at Campus Kristiansand. 

With a solid decade of experience as a graphic designer, I decided a career shift into the world of front-end development.
As a front-end developer, I've transitioned from focusing solely on the aestehetics to putting the user experience in center.
